# Phonotactic learning investigation

Many African languages use clicks as consonants and in this study, we investigated phonotactic learning by native English speakers of first-order constraints with two types of clicks, dental and alveolar. 

Specifically, we are interested in whether people can implicitly learn phonotactic constraints involving sounds that do not occur in their native language. Learning was measured through the types of speech errors produced. If these errors tend to obey the experiment’s rule, learning has taken place. However, if they don’t, learning has not taken place. The experiment involved participants reciting consonant-vowel-consonant syllables on two different days and the rules involved whether a click can occur in the beginning or end of a syllable. The first day was a practice/ training session and the second day was the actual experiment. The results show that English speakers did learn the click positions when compared to the regular-consonants through restricted and unrestricted legality errors. But clicks do not stick to their positions as much as the regular consonants do. This implies that English speakers do not treat clicks like other consonants.
